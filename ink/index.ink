This is a work in progress. There are TONS of holes and dialogue not done –  we are actively working to fill. In the meantime, feel free to play it. # CLASS: non-datapad-action
Since you not viewing this on a Datapad – and we don't have things like an M-Band, Ship Console or an Engineering Room etc. to move the story along – we had to make a few accommodations to interact here. # CLASS: non-datapad-action
Items in italics (like this text) are utilitarian only and not found in the Datapad experience. # CLASS: non-datapad-action
